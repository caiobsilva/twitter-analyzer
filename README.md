# twitter-analyzer
Repository for a Twitter network analysis tool made for my bachelor's thesis. Features include centrality metrics, community finding, and an interactive network canvas, all generated by a user's input.

More detail can be found in the thesis publication (available in Portuguese only).

## Disclaimer
This is not a production-ready project, and is available for demonstration purporses only. It runs on development HTTP servers, and lacks features such as authentications or unit tests, as I do not intend to maintain it further.

## Building the project
_This project uses the Twitter V2 API, which requires developer authentication. In order to use it locally, a valid API key must be supplied._

1. Run `make setup` to check for dependencies and set up the application
2. Fill in the environment variables in the `.development.env` file
3. `make local-run` to execute the application locally, with a development instance of Neo4J
